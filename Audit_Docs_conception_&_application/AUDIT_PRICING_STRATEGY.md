## Pricing Research Findings

### Impulse Buy Territory ($27–$47)

| Source | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| Sam Matla (MC-6) | $27, $49, $99 = psychologically friendly price points; start low, track data, raise 20–50% |
| Instagram/creator advice | $27–$37 = "affordable enough for impulse buys" |
| Twitter (BasKE, Zack) | $37–$47 product page → impulse buys; typical conversion funnel |
| Trust Ladder | $27 → $97–$497 → $1K–$10K |

### Chosen Price: **$39**

- Sits in the sweet spot for automated products
- No psychological resistance (below $50)
- High enough to signal value, low enough to fly off shelves
- Aligns with WHITE_CLAW_2DAY_AUDIT.md validation tier ($49 first 25) — $39 is more aggressive for instant digital product

## Offer Structure (Live)

| Offer | Price | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **WhiteClaw Audit** | $39 | Automated product (Claude skill). Instant delivery. Lead magnet. |
| **Strategy Call** | $100/hr | Human service. Value of expert time. Encourages $39 purchase. |
| **Audit + Call Bundle** | $139 | Best value. Full unlock. |

## Flow

1. **Lead with $39 audit** — Primary CTA. Instant yes. No commitment.
2. **Strategy call ($100/hr)** — For those who want done-for-you. Positions the audit as the logical first step.
3. **During/after call** — Recommend the $39 audit if they haven't bought; use it as implementation guide.
4. **Result** — Automation ($39) sells. Strategy call drives done-for-you. Both support each other.

---

## Audit Docs Alignment

- **WHITE_CLAW_2DAY_AUDIT.md:** $49 first 25 → $100. We chose $39 for the *automated* audit (no human delivery cost).
- **SERVICE_DELIVERY_PLAYBOOK.md:** Strategy call maps to Lite/Pro human delivery. $100/hr = fair value for expert time.
- **README / CASE_STUDY:** "One-command recovery" + "No debugging" = core messaging. Audit delivers blueprint; call delivers build.
